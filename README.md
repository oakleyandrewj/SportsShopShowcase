asp.net core 3.1 showcase app

Written as an update for my portfolio as I had some old ASP.net WebForms and MVC experience, but after using .net core 2.1 on a work project I wanted to have something up-to-date that I can use to show my skills

I'm using this to show:

- a locally-functioning .net core showcase site 
- EF Core/migrations
- MVC patterns in .net core
- Dependency Injection/Container Usage
- Razor syntax usage
- responsive front end design with bootstrap and JQuery

Created Spring 2021
Summer 2021 the idea is to extend with some authentication enhancements, use this to showcase some testing, and hopefully push this to the cloud to run as part of a live portfolio

works locally on IIS Express\Kestrel so feel free to fork a copy, inspect, build/run locally, and we can talk about this further.
